# MyShortStory

Once upon a time, there was an elf called Pellegrino. Pellegrino was on vacation from his usual work as Santa's helper. He was wearing waldo's red striped shirt. 

Pellegrino jumped over the fence to the autokart dome to play with the karts.

He didn't see the karts coming and was running for his life. He dodged many karts until finally he spotted an escape.

He then jumped to a kart and got inside and drove away.

And then he lived happily ever after. 

It didn't end there, Pellegrino found a secret portal to neverland.

He found that Neverland was the future run by an elite group of people who possessed the knowledge from the "Book of Powers". The only way to decrypt the book and acquire that knowledge was to master the language of Python.
