Once upon a time, there was an elf called Pellegrino. 

Pellegrino jumped over the fence to the autokart dome to play with the karts.

He didn't see the karts coming and was running for his life. He dodged many karts until finally he spotted an escape.

He then jumped to a kart and got inside and drove away.

He reached at the end of the road, where there was a fork. There was a road that lead to a nice green daisy landscape, and another that went to the desert.
